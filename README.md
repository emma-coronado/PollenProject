# PollenProject
## Motivation
This project wants to develop an image analysis program to quantify pine pollen germination rates from microscope images. Pollen is germinated on agar plates and the pictures are using a dark background and high contrast to maximize visibility. Rather than counting by hand, we implement our own detection and counting process to identify the pollen grains and then classify them as germinated or not based on pollen tube presence.
